                            When we first opened the doors of our Hamilton cannabis store, people were constantly telling us how frustrating it is trying to find a reliable, welcoming weed dispensary in Hamilton.

                        <p>
                            Are you just getting started, and want to check out some weed accessories like weed pipes, grinders, or bongs? Do you want to start traditionally with rolling papers, or some convenient
                            pre-rolled joints?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Have you been smoking for quite a while, and you're looking to branch out into some of the other types of products that are made from cannabis? If you want to smoke, but without all the
                            carcinogens, we've got weed vaporizers, vape pens and vape cartridges, all at your disposal.

                            Perhaps, you've been interested in trying some more consumable forms of cannabis. We've got edibles, cannabis drinks, and cannabis oils, waiting for you. Or maybe, you want to take things
                            to the next level and dip your toe into the mass amount of cannabis concentrates that have made their way onto the market. We've got shatter, hash, and live resin, ready to knock your
                            socks off.

                            without any of the psychoactive effects.
